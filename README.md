## Installation

### Ubuntu

Open `Terminal` and proceed with following instructions:

1. (Optionally) Upgrade your system to latest packages including latest available kernel by running `apt-get full-upgrade`.
After kernel upgrade reboot is required.
2. Ensure that you have source repositories configured for APT - run `vi /etc/apt/sources.list` and make sure that there is
at least one line starting with `deb-src` is present and uncommented.
3. Install pre-requisites - run `sudo apt install -y software-properties-common python3-launchpadlib gnupg2 linux-headers-$(uname -r)`.
4. Run `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:amnezia/ppa`.
5. Finally execute `sudo apt-get install -y amneziawg`.

### Debian

Open `Terminal` and do next steps:

1. (Optionally) Upgrade your system to latest packages including latest available kernel by running `apt-get full-upgrade`.
   After kernel upgrade reboot is required.
2. Ensure that you have source repositories configured for APT - run `vi /etc/apt/sources.list` and make sure that there is
   at least one line starting with `deb-src` is present and uncommented.
3. Execute following commands:
```shell
sudo apt install -y software-properties-common python3-launchpadlib gnupg2 linux-headers-$(uname -r)
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 57290828
echo "deb https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/amnezia/ppa/ubuntu focal main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
echo "deb-src https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/amnezia/ppa/ubuntu focal main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y amneziawg
```

### Linux Mint

Open `Software Sources` and make sure that `Source code repositories` (under `Optional Sources`) are enabled.

Proceed to `PPAs` section and add `ppa:amnezia/ppa` PPA repository, after that save configuration and rebuild `apt` cache.

After that, open `Terminal` and run:

```shell
sudo apt-get install -y amneziawg
```

### RHEL/CentOS/SUSE/Fedora Core

*If you use release that doesn't have DKMS support out of the box, you may need to install [EPEL](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/#_quickstart) first.*

Open `Terminal` and run:

```shell
sudo dnf copr enable amneziavpn/amneziawg
sudo dnf install amneziawg-dkms amneziawg-tools
```

Before installation it is strictly recommended to upgrade your system kernel to the latest available version and perform
the reboot afterwards.

## Manual build

You may need to install kernel headers and/or build essentials packages before running following steps.

1. In Terminal:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/amnezia-vpn/amneziawg-linux-kernel-module.git
    cd amneziawg-linux-kernel-module/src
    ```

2. Now, if you run modern Linux with kernel version 5.6+, you need to download your kernel's source from anywhere possible
and link resulting tree to `kernel` symlink:
    
    ```shell
    ln -s /path/to/kernel/source kernel
    ```
    
    Please note to find and provide full kernel sourcetree, not only headers. **If you run on legacy kernel (<5.6), you do not need to perform this step.**

3. Now perform build and installation:
    ```shell
    make
    sudo make install
    ```
   
    Or on a capable system you may want to use DKMS for this:
    ```shell
    sudo make dkms-install
    sudo dkms add -m amneziawg -v 1.0.0
    sudo dkms build -m amneziawg -v 1.0.0
    sudo dkms install -m amneziawg -v 1.0.0
    ```

## Configuration

### Configuration file path

The configuration file must be located in the directory: `/etc/amnezia/amneziawg/`

The configuration file name must comply with the following regular expression: `awg[0-9]+\.conf`

### Configuration file content

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All parameters should be the same between Client and Server, except Jc - it can vary.

#### `[Interface]` block:

- Jc — 1 ≤ Jc ≤ 128; recommended range is from 3 to 10 inclusive
- Jmin — Jmin < Jmax; recommended value is 50
- Jmax — Jmin < Jmax ≤ 1280; recommended value is 1000
- S1 — S1 < 1280; S1 + 56 ≠ S2; recommended range is from 15 to 150 inclusive
- S2 — S2 < 1280; recommended range is from 15 to 150 inclusive
- H1/H2/H3/H4 — must be unique among each other; recommended range is from 5 to 2147483647 inclusive
- Address — The IP address and subnet assigned to the local interface (e.g., 10.0.0.1/24).
- DNS — DNS server(s) to use for name resolution when this interface is active.
- PrivateKey — The private key of the local WireGuard interface (kept secret).

#### `[Peer]` block

- PublicKey — The public key of the remote peer (shared openly).
- PresharedKey — An optional shared key for added encryption security between peers.
- AllowedIPs — The list of IPs/routes allowed through the tunnel (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0 for all traffic).
- Endpoint — The public IP address and port of the remote WireGuard peer.
- PersistentKeepalive — Optional parameter to maintain the connection when behind NAT (value in seconds, e.g., 25).

## Troubleshooting

> [!TIP]
> Please check [Ubuntu Server documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/how-to/wireguard-vpn/troubleshooting) for more troubleshooting steps.

### Enable debug logging

To get more details, you can enable the dynamic debug feature for the module:

```shell
echo "module amneziawg +p" | sudo tee /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control
```

This will log messages to dmesg, which can be watched live with:
```shell
dmesg -wT
```

### Low space on `/tmp` filesystem

Most installation instructions above assume that you have enough space in system's `/tmp` partition (as setup script needs 
to manipulate with kernel's sourcetree which is pretty huge).

If you can not afford enough space in your `/tmp`, you may override temporary dir by setting `AWG_TEMP_DIR` environment variable
before the installation:

```shell
export AWG_TEMP_DIR="/home/ubuntu/tmp"
```

This setting should persist for future and will not require repeating.

### Kernel sourcetree could not be found automatically

In some rare cases, setup script may not find your kernel's sourcetree automatically. You may find appropriate sources by yourself
then and link them to DKMS module sources, e.g.

```shell
ln -s /path/to/your/kernel/sources /usr/src/amneziawg-1.0.0/kernel
```

Reinstall the package thereafter and you should get everything working.

Should you upgrade your kernel in the future, please remember that you may also need refresh sourcetree and update symlinks.
